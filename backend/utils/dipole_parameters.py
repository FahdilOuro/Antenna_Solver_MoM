    This module implements the computation of electromagnetic fields and associated properties
    from triangle, edge, and current data for an antenna.

    Main functionalities:
        1. Calculation of centers and dipole moments associated with the edges of a triangular mesh.
        2. Determination of radiated and scattered electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields at an observation point.
        3. Calculation of power density (Poynting vector), radiation density, and radiation intensity.

    Main inputs:
        * triangles_data: Contains triangle data, including their centers and edge-related indices.
        * edges_data: Contains lengths and the total number of edges.
        * current_data: Array of electric currents associated with the mesh edges.
        * observation_point: Point in space where the fields will be computed (3D vector).
        * eta: Characteristic impedance of the medium.
        * complex_k: Complex wavenumber of the medium.
